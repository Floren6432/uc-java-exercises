# uc-java-exercises

Just some programming exercises I did during my second-year of study at university.

They cover basic concepts like input/output, conditionals, loops, array manipulation, simple calculators, and control flow.

TL;DR: Java basics, beginner exercises, console apps, control structures, arrays

Instructions: 
Just download the .zip file, 
then open Eclipse and go to File > Import > Existing Projects into Workspace to import it, 
or simply drop the folder into your Eclipse workspace.
